        <p>Welcome to WebsiteRNerds where I have compiled everything you'll need to join the many Minecraft Servers we have made. Including: Mods, discord servers, aternos dashboards and instructions on how to use them.</p>
        <h3 class="title">Installing Java</h3>
        <p>Before you join any of the modded servers you'll need to install Java and no I don't mean Minecraft Java Edition. Java is something completely different that makes your computer load the mods properly. To install it got the link below, click download for whichever OS your running, when it pops up click "Install Client" and then follow the installation wizard before carrying on to the next step. You may need to restart your device after installing it.</p>
